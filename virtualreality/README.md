## Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation using Virtual Reality

#### This project is based on two domains the first one is BCI(Brain Computer Interface) and second one is VR(Virtual Reality).

#### But the question is ,What is BCI?


### BCI - Brain Computer Interface
 Brain Computer Interface is the concept of connecting human brain to the computing device with a goal to control the human brain. This concept has actually arrived from the    studies of Neuroscience. Neuroscience is the field of science which focuses on studying the neurons of living organisms. Neurons are the core part of human bodies too the signal which we receive from environment and process it the brain are actually done through the neurons present in our body. But coming to BCI there are two categories of BCI.
 
 ### Categories of BCI
 1. Invasive BCI
 2. Non-Invasive BCI

#### Invasive BCI
In Invasive BCI the electrodes which are used to control the human brain are implanted inside the human brain. Example for this is the [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/) project funded by Elon Musk.

#### Non-Invasive BCI
In Non-Invasive BCI there is no need to implant the electrodes inside the brain instead it sticked to the essential part of the brain where the neurons are mostly active.

### VR - Virtual Reality
Virtual Reality is the simulation of the real environment. We all know the metaverse which is trending technology, it is also being called the new version of the internet. The word metaverse is derived from the meta which means __beyond__ and verse meaning __universe__. Now enough talking about the domains let's dive into project. 

### What is Galvanic?
Galvanic is aka galvanic current is the process of the passing the electric current to the __vestibular labyrinth__. Vestibular Labyrinth are the sensory organs below the ear.
