## Galvanic Vestibular Simulation using Virtual Reality

#### This project is based on two domains the first one is BCI(Brain Computer Interface) and second one is VR(Virtual Reality). But the question is ,What is BCI?


### BCI - Brain Computer Interface
 Brain Computer Interface is the concept of connecting human brain to the computing device with a goal to control the human brain. This concept has actually arrived from the    studies of Neuroscience. Neuroscience is the field of science which focuses on studying the neurons of living organisms. Neurons are the core part of human bodies too the signal which we receive from environment and process it the brain are actually done through the neurons present in our body. But coming to BCI there are two categories of BCI.
 
 ### Categories of BCI
 1. Invasive BCI
 2. Non-Invasive BCI
